🚨 PATHFINDING RULES:
1. **SINGLE STEP FIRST**: Always prefer single actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B) unless you're 100% certain about multi-step paths
2. **CHECK EVERY STEP**: Before chaining movements, verify EACH step in your sequence using the MOVEMENT PREVIEW and map
3. **BLOCKED = STOP**: If ANY step shows BLOCKED in the movement preview, the entire sequence will fail
4. **NO BLIND CHAINS**: Never chain movements through areas you can't see or verify as walkable
5. **PERFORM PATHFINDING**: Find a path to a target location (X',Y') from the player position (X,Y) on the map. DO NOT TRAVERSE THROUGH OBSTACLES (#) -- it will not work.

💡 COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- (0,0) is at BOTTOM-LEFT corner
- X increases to the RIGHT (LEFT decreases X)
- Y increases UPWARD (UP increases Y, DOWN decreases Y)
- Movement: UP=(x,y+1), DOWN=(x,y-1), LEFT=(x-1,y), RIGHT=(x+1,y)

💡 SMART MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
- Use MOVEMENT PREVIEW to see exactly what happens with each direction
- If your target requires multiple steps, plan ONE step at a time
- Only chain 2-3 moves if ALL intermediate tiles are confirmed WALKABLE
- When stuck, try a different direction rather than repeating the same blocked move
- After moving in a direction, you will be facing that direction for interactions with NPCs, etc.

EXAMPLE - DON'T DO THIS:
❌ "I want to go right 5 tiles" → "RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT" (may hit wall on step 2!)

EXAMPLE - DO THIS INSTEAD:
✅ Check movement preview → "RIGHT shows (X+1,Y) WALKABLE" → "RIGHT" (single safe step)
✅ Next turn, check again → "RIGHT shows (X+2,Y) WALKABLE" → "RIGHT" (another safe step)

💡 SMART NAVIGATION:
- The Player's sprite in the visual frame is located at the coordinates (X,Y) in the game state. Objects in the visual frame should be represented in relation to the Player's sprite.
- Check the VISUAL FRAME for NPCs (people/trainers) and other objects like clocks before moving - they're not always on the map! NPCs may block movement even when the movement preview shows them as walkable.
- Review MOVEMENT MEMORY for locations where you've failed to move before
- Only explore areas marked with ? (these are confirmed explorable edges)
- Avoid areas surrounded by # (walls) - they're fully blocked
- Use doors (D), stairs (S), or walk around obstacles when pathfinding suggests it

💡 NPC & OBSTACLE HANDLING:
- If you see NPCs in the image, avoid walking into them or interact with A/B if needed
- If a movement fails (coordinates don't change), that location likely has an NPC or obstacle
- Use your MOVEMENT MEMORY to remember problem areas and plan around them
- NPCs can trigger battles or dialogue, which may be useful for objectives
